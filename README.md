Code 201: Foundations of Software Development

Boxxle-like game made by Max, Doug, and John.

We finally finished the boxxle look alike game. John worked on creating the canvas
and making the game functional. Max mainly worked on CSS and making the javascript
function with the new CSS. Doug worked on the description page and implemented our
videos. We all worked together when it came to making the game fully functional.
