          <p class='initialParagraphs'> Hello, do you ever miss playing the old school gameboy games when
            you were a kid? Or if you are a kid now, you probably never got the luxury
            of playing classic mind challenging yet simple games. It is sad that we are
            getting to that era where people hardly remember what a gameboy is. Team Game Boyz has
            made it our goal to bring that little bit of childhood joy back into your life and
            if you have never played a gameboy before we want to open your eyes to the fact
            that not all games were always played on a phone or tablet. We hope to achieve this
            by bringing back the classic game Boxxle back to life. If you have never heard
            of boxxle before, please check out our description page to learn all about it. </p>

          <p class= 'initialParagraphs'> Before we get to the fun of playing this awesome game, please enter a username for
            yourself below and click the save button. This will keep your game data saved so you
            can leave the page and come back to the level you finished on. Once you click save a
            gameboy will pop up and when you click on that, you will be able to start the game. </p>
